# Our Villager Discounts

#### A Minecraft mod for sharing villager discounts across players

The earliest support version of Minecraft is 1.16.2.

### Why?

This should simply be a datapack, but there is an [open
issue](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-153392) as of 1.14.2 concerning the
deletion and modification of villager NBT data. As this data can't be changed
through commands, I've opted to make this mod in the meanwhile.

### Launcher support

This project only supports the
[Fabric](https://github.com/Gremlite/MinecraftMod-OurVillagerDiscounts/tree/fabric)
launcher. Support for each launcher will be managed on its own branch.

There will be support in future for the
[Forge](https://github.com/Gremlite/MinecraftMod-OurVillagerDiscounts/tree/forge)
launcher.
